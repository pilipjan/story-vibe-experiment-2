# HEPHAESTUS RIG: An AI Narrative Architecture Experiment

Welcome to the **Hephaestus Rig**, a modular narrative project built as an experiment in "AI Narrative Architecture." This project treats storytelling like a codebase—modular, version-controlled, and organized into logical components.

## 🌌 The Concept
This story was generated using the **Antigravity Agent** acting as a "Lead Narrative Architect." The project was structured into a modular filesystem to maintain consistency across world-building, character development, and prose style.

- **Genre:** Sci-Fi (Gritty, Cinematic)
- **Engine:** Antigravity AI
- **Experiment Type:** "AI Vibe Code Style" Storytelling

## 📂 Project Structure
- `/Manuscript`: Contains the individual chapters and the full compiled story.
- `/Characters`: Modular profiles for Elias Thorne and Sarah Holloway.
- `/World_Building`: Documentation on the "Speculative Logic" of the project (e.g., The Sentient Virus, Viral Space, and Simulation Stability).
- `Narrative_Arch_Status.md`: The "config file" used to track the project's meta-data and architectural state.

## 📖 The Story: "The Heartbeat in the Wire"
In a deep-space mining outpost hanging over a dormant singularity, a maintenance engineer discovers that his station—and perhaps his reality—is being rewritten by an ancient, sentient virus.

### **Lead Narrative Architect Protocols Used:**
1. **The Lore Keeper:** Maintained technical consistency in "Viral Space" rules.
2. **The Stylist:** Enforced a gritty, industrial prose style.
3. **The Auditor:** Scanned for pacing and logic errors during "Scene Audits."
4. **The Researcher:** Integrated speculative physics and digital-organic hybrid concepts.
