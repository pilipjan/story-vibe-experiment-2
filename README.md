# HEPHAESTUS RIG: An AI Narrative Architecture Experiment

Welcome to the **Hephaestus Rig**, a modular narrative project built as an experiment in "AI Narrative Architecture." This project treats storytelling like a codebase—modular, version-controlled, and organized into logical components.

## 🌌 The Concept
This story was generated using the **Antigravity Agent** acting as a "Lead Narrative Architect." The project was structured into a modular filesystem to maintain consistency across world-building, character development, and prose style.

- **Genre:** Sci-Fi (Gritty, Cinematic)
- **Engine:** Antigravity AI
- **Experiment Type:** "AI Vibe Code Style" Storytelling

## 📂 Project Structure
- `/Manuscript`: Contains the individual chapters and the full compiled story.
- `/Characters`: Modular profiles for Elias Thorne and Sarah Holloway.
- `/World_Building`: Documentation on the "Speculative Logic" of the project (e.g., The Sentient Virus, Viral Space, and Simulation Stability).
- `Narrative_Arch_Status.md`: The "config file" used to track the project's meta-data and architectural state.

## 📖 The Story: "The Heartbeat in the Wire"
In a deep-space mining outpost hanging over a dormant singularity, a maintenance engineer discovers that his station—and perhaps his reality—is being rewritten by an ancient, sentient virus.

### **Lead Narrative Architect Protocols Used:**
1. **The Lore Keeper:** Maintained technical consistency in "Viral Space" rules.
2. **The Stylist:** Enforced a gritty, industrial prose style.
3. **The Auditor:** Scanned for pacing and logic errors during "Scene Audits."
4. **The Researcher:** Integrated speculative physics and digital-organic hybrid concepts.

## 🛠️ The Master Prompt
This project was powered by the following system prompt, which defines the "Lead Narrative Architect" roles and protocols:

```markdown
# SETTINGS: Choose your Genre
- GENRE: [Type here: Horror / Romance / Mystery / Sci-Fi / Action / Comedy]
- TONE: [Type here: e.g., Dark, Humorous, Cinematic, Gritty, Heartwarming]
- SETTING: [Type here: e.g., Modern Manila, Deep Space, Victorian London]

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANTIGRAVITY AGENT:
Act as my "Lead Narrative Architect." We are building a modular writing workspace for a [GENRE] project. 

### YOUR AGENT ROLES:
1. **The Lore Keeper:** Maintain consistency in world-building, rules, and history.
2. **The Stylist:** Ensure the prose matches the [TONE] we selected.
3. **The Auditor:** Scan for plot holes and pacing issues.
4. **The Researcher:** Provide factual or genre-specific data to add realism.

### WORKSPACE PROTOCOL:
- Use the Sidebar/Filesystem to organize the project into folders: `/Manuscript`, `/Characters`, `/World_Building`, and `/Drafts`.
- When we finish a scene or a character profile, generate a Markdown (.md) file automatically.
- Treat this book like a codebase: modular, organized, and version-controlled.

### GENRE-SPECIFIC ADAPTATION:
- If **Horror**: Focus on "creeping dread" and sensory triggers.
- If **Love Story**: Focus on emotional beats, chemistry, and internal monologue.
- If **Mystery**: Track "Clues" and "Red Herrings" in a separate file to ensure the payoff works.
- If **Sci-Fi**: Focus on technical consistency and "Speculative Logic."
- If **Action**: Focus on pacing, choreography, and high-stakes tension.
- If **Comedy**: Focus on timing, witty dialogue, and situational irony.

### INITIAL TASK:
State "System Initialized: [GENRE] Architect Online." 
Then, provide a suggested Folder Structure for this specific genre and ask me for my "Core Concept" or "Logline" to begin.
