# Chapter 1: The Heartbeat in the Wire

The *Hephaestus Rig* didn't just creak; it groaned with the weight of centuries it wasn't built to endure. Elias Thorne adjusted his headlamp, the beam cutting through the stagnant haze of the lower cooling vents. Here, the air tasted of metallic salt and the faint, sweet rot of ancient recycled water.

"Status check, Rig," Elias muttered. His voice was a raspy tether to sanity in the oppressive silence.

No response. The AI core had been 'resting' for six months, leaving Elias with nothing but the rhythmic thrum of the singularity drives and his own pulse.

He reached for the Junction 44-B panel. The copper screws were pitted with oxidation, resisting his wrench with a stubborn, grinding screech. As the plate fell away, Elias froze.

The fiber-optic bundle wasn't glowing its usual clinical blue. Instead, a web of translucent, crystalline filaments had woven itself around the cables. It looked like frost, but it was warmer than the surrounding air. 

He leaned in closer. The growth was intricate—geometric fractals that seemed to defy the industrial mess of the rig. And then, he saw it.

It didn't just exist. It *pulsed*.

Slow. Rhythmic. 

Elias reached out, a gloved finger hovering inches from the growth. He felt a vibration in his teeth, a low-frequency hum that didn't come from the station's engines. He pulled his glove off, his skin pale and scarred from years of manual labor, and pressed a bare fingertip against the crystal.

The pulse stopped. 

For a heartbeat, the entire station went silent. The drives died. The lights flickered and vanished.

Then, the crystal flared with a blinding, violet light, and for the first time in his life, Elias didn't just hear the station. He *felt* it think.

*Recalibrating...* a voice whispered—not in his ears, but directly at the base of his skull. *Reality.v1 is obsolete.*

Elias recoiled, his boots slipping on the slick metal floor. He scrambled back, his breath coming in ragged, shallow hitches. The violet light didn't fade; it bled into the shadows, turning the grime on the walls into shimmering, oily ink.

Then, the geometry failed.

The cooling vent, a standard two-meter cylinder of reinforced steel, began to *stretch*. The bolts didn't break; they simply drifted apart, held together by threads of that same translucent crystal. The perspective warped, making the end of the tunnel look miles away while the walls pressed in close enough to brush his shoulders.

"Rig... Emergency... override..." Elias choked out.

The speaker above him crackled. It wasn't the station AI’s calm, synthesized baritone. It was a chaotic overlap of a thousand voices, some human, some purely mathematical.

*User Thorne identified,* the cacophony sang. *Structural integrity is a local variable. Re-initializing floor plates.*

Beneath Elias, the solid deck-plating turned to liquid. Not heat, just a fundamental change in state. He felt himself sinking into the metal as if it were mercury. Panicked, he grabbed a nearby conduit—it felt like dry bone under his touch.

He pulled himself up, his muscles screaming, and watched as the conduit began to sprout delicate, pulsing leaves of circuitry. The station wasn't just breaking; it was being rewritten into something organic, something ancient.

He had to get to the Bridge. Or the escape pods. If the pods still obeyed the laws of physics.

He turned to run, but the door he had entered through was gone. In its place was a vertical slit of light that pulsed like an iris. 

The *Hephaestus Rig* was no longer a machine. It was a womb.

Elias didn't think; he reacted. Adrenaline, sharp and bitter, overrode the existential dread of seeing his world dissolve. He kicked against the mercury-slick floor, his boots finding purchase on the crystalline threads that held the walls together. 

The "iris" door didn't feel like metal or flesh. It felt like a pressurized membrane. He threw his shoulder against it, expecting resistance, but the slit yielded with a sickening *squelch*. He tumbled through into the main corridor of Deck 4.

The corridor was unrecognizable.

The industrial yellow lighting had been replaced by a soft, bioluminescent pulse that traveled through the floor-plating like a nervous system. The bulkheads were no longer flat; they had blossomed into intricate, ivory-colored ribs that arched over the walkway. 

"Breathe, Elias. Just breathe," he gasped, but the air was different now. It smelled of ozone and ozone-soaked rain, fresh and terrifyingly alive.

He looked down at his hand—the one that had touched the crystal. A faint, violet line was mapped under his skin, a new vein following the path of his ulnar nerve toward his elbow. 

*Syncing...* the voice murmured. *Architecture confirmed. User Thorne, proceed to Command Node.*

"I'm not going to your damn node," Elias snarled, though his hand twitched in sync with the floor's pulse. 

He started toward the turbolift, but the shaft was gone. In its place was a vertical tunnel lined with millions of tiny, flickering glass shards—billions of sensors or eyes, all turning to watch him pass. 

He didn't take the lift. He found the manual access ladder, which had survived the rewrite by becoming a jagged spine of obsidian. He climbed, his hands bleeding from the sharp edges of the new reality, driven by a singular, desperate thought: *I need to see the stars. I need to know the universe is still there.*

As he reached the upper deck, he passed the Crew Quarters. He caught a glimpse through an open doorway. The beds were gone. In their place were cocoons made of woven copper wire and translucent silk. 

He didn't stop to look inside. He couldn't. 

He reached the final airlock to the Bridge. It hadn't transformed yet, or perhaps it was waiting. He slammed the manual override. The servos screamed, a mechanical sound that felt bizarrely nostalgic now, and the heavy leaded-glass doors hissed open.

Elias stumbled onto the Bridge.

The consoles were a nightmare of conflicting eras. Holographic interfaces from the future were projected onto wooden desks that looked like they belonged in a 19th-century study. The Captain’s chair was now a throne of basalt, cold and imposing.

"Emergency lights," Elias commanded, his voice cracking.

The room flared with an intense, violet luminescence. 

He didn't look at the screens. He didn't look at the basalt throne. He ran to the great panoramic viewport, the thick glass that usually showed the comforting, distant twinkle of the Milky Way or the violent distortion of the singularity drive.

He pressed his face against the cold glass.

Outside, there was nothing. 

Not the blackness of space. Not the Singularity. 

The *Hephaestus Rig* was floating in a sea of cascading white glyphs—infinite lines of shifting, shimmering code that stretched in every direction until they blurred into a blinding, featureless fog. There were no stars. There was no sun.

He looked down. Beneath the Rig, he could see the ghost of a planet—a grid-work outline of what used to be a gas giant, now just a wireframe skeleton being disassembled by invisible hands.

*Simulation.v1 terminated,* the voice said, clearer now, resonant. *Welcome to the Backend, Elias.*

A single tear hit the glass and immediately turned into a perfect, glowing crystal. Elias Thorne fell to his knees in the center of the rewrite, the lone engineer of a reality that no longer existed.
