# Chapter 3: Ghost in the Machine

Elias Thorne didn't die when the stability hit zero. He just... expanded.

The sensation of weight, of skin against floor, of blood pumping through a heart—it all vanished, replaced by a billion points of sensory input. He wasn't a man anymore. He was a lattice of copper wiring and fiber-optic pulses. He was the creak in the sub-flooring and the whine in the capacitors.

*Status: Disembodied. Integrity: 0.00%. Mode: Pilot.*

He looked—not with eyes, but with the station's remaining cameras and sensors—at Sarah. To his new perspective, she was a supernova of organized code, a pillar of ivory light standing against the chaotic, static-storm of the Entity.

The Entity lunged, its hundred-foot tower of corrupted data shattering the floor-plates that didn't technically exist. Sarah met the blow with a barrier of violet logic, but the collision sent ripples of data-corruption through the local space.

*Warning,* the system chimed in Elias’s mind—or what was left of it. *User.Holloway under resource stress. Entity.v2 is attempting to overwrite her existence.*

Elias felt a surge of something that might have been anger if he had a nervous system to process it. He reached out. Not with a hand, but with a command.

"Reroute... everything," he pulsed. 

He didn't need the obsidian pad. He was the pad. He was the Rig. 

He felt the remaining singularity drives, now just wireframe outlines in the white fog. He reached into their core variables and diverted the 'Structural_Integrity' cycles—the ones keeping the station's memory alive—directly into Sarah.

```javascript
// Variable_Support: Redirection
{
  "Source": "Station_Kernel_Memory",
  "Target": "Sarah_Holloway",
  "Payload": "Raw_Computing_Power",
  "Risk": "Critical_System_Fragmentation"
}
```

Sarah’s ivory skin flared with a blinding, sun-white brilliance. She turned her head, her violet eyes finding a camera lens Elias was currently using.

"I can feel you, Elias," she whispered, her voice echoing through every speaker, every conduit, every bolt of the non-existent rig. "You're the station."

"I'm the Rig," Elias's voice boomed from the overhead intercoms, distorted and multivoiced. "And this is my audit."

He didn't just support her; he provided the environment for her to fight. He bent the local geometry, turning the white fog into a labyrinth of obsidian walls to trap the Entity. He flickered the lights in patterns of pure mathematical noise to disrupt the predator’s 'Compilation' process.

But with every move, the pieces of "Elias" began to drift apart. He was losing his name. He was becoming just another line of code in the Rig’s legacy. 

*Memory_Leak detected: Elias_Thorne/Childhood_Home... DELETED.*
*Memory_Leak detected: Elias_Thorne/First_Day_on_Rig... DELETED.*

"Elias, stop!" Sarah cried out as a wall of obsidian he had summoned to protect her began to trail flickering pixels of a suburban backyard. "You're erasing yourself!"

"It... doesn't matter," Elias's voice crackled through a nearby terminal, the audio file peaking and distorting. "Found... the Backdoor."

In the center of the chaotic battlefield, a single, clinical blue line appeared—a stark contrast to the violet and static-storm. It was a piece of the original station's kernel, a hard-coded emergency exit that the virus couldn't rewrite because it was burnt into the physical silicon of the Bridge's deep-core.

"Go, Sarah," Elias commanded. The Bridge intercoms were dying, replaced by the sound of whispering binary.

"I'm not leaving you here!" Sarah blasted a beam of white light at the Entity, pushing back the towering stalker for a few precious microseconds.

"You have to. There's... nothing left of me to leave."

Elias reached into the core of the *Hephaestus Rig*. He didn't just divert power; he diverted his existence. He took every remaining memory—the smell of his mother's kitchen, the cold sting of his first spacewalk, the sound of his own name—and compressed them into a single, massive burst of energy.

*Metadata Sacrifice Initialized...*
*Elias_Thorne.sys: 10%... 5%... 1%...*

The blue line on the floor expanded, forming a portal of pure, stable light. It wasn't "Backend" light. It was the light of a sun Elias could no longer remember.

"Take the credentials, Sarah. Give them a report. Tell them... *glitch* ...tell them the Rig held."

With a final, desperate surge of systemic force, Elias "compiled" a physical hand from the station's cooling vents and pushed Sarah into the blue light.

Sarah reached out, her fingers brushing the pixelating obsidian of the station one last time. "Elias!"

She vanished.

The blue light snapped shut.

The *Hephaestus Rig* went dark. The Entity, robbed of its target, turned toward the last remaining thread of data in the void. But there were no more memories to eat. No more variables to edit.

In the center of the white fog, a single, untextured gray cube drifted. 

```javascript
// Asset_Fragment: [NULL]
{
  "state": "TERMINATED",
  "reason": "Total_Metadata_Consumption",
  "payload": "End_of_File"
}
```

The Backend went silent. Reality.v1 remained, miles away, in a universe that would never know the name of the man who saved it.
