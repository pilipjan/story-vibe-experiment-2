# Epilogue: Reality.v1 Reclaimed

The stars weren't Cascading white glyphs. They were points of ancient, hydrogen-burning light, indifferent and cold. To Sarah Holloway, they were the most beautiful things she had ever seen.

She sat in the cramped medical bay of the *RSS Valentina*, the rescue frigate that had picked up her escape pod drifting three light-weeks from the dead coordinates of the Hephaestus Rig. The air hummed with the sound of actual, physical fans. The walls were made of steel that didn't pulse, didn't whisper, and stayed exactly where they were built to be.

"Officer Holloway?" 

The ship’s medic, a woman with tired eyes and a name Sarah couldn't yet process, held out a cup of coffee. Real coffee. It smelled of earth and bitterness.

"You've been staring at that viewport for three hours," the medic said gently. "We’ve scanned the area twice. There’s no debris. No Rig. Just... nothing. Are you sure about the coordinates?"

Sarah took a sip of the coffee. It burned her throat, a grounding, physical pain. She looked down at her arm. 

The violet vein was gone. Her skin was human again—imperfect, dusted with the grit of a station that no longer existed. But when she closed her eyes, she could still hear a faint, distant vibration. A rhythm that matched her own heartbeat.

"The Rig held," Sarah whispered.

She reached into the pocket of her flight suit and pulled out a small, untextured gray cube. To the medic, it looked like a piece of industrial plastic, a bit of scrap metal from a ruined bulkhead. 

But as Sarah held it, the cube flickered with a faint, amber light—for a microsecond, the ghost of a man's smile appeared on its surface.

"I have the report," Sarah said, her voice steady. "I have the variables. Tell the Captain to prep the long-range transmitter. The Backend is still out there, and someone needs to know the name of the man who closed the door."

Outside, the *Valentina* turned its engines toward Earth. Behind them, in the silent dark of the sector once known as Hephaestus, a single pixel of violet light flared once, then vanished into the infinite black.
