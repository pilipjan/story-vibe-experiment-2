# Speculative Logic: The Sentient Virus & Station Tech

## The Virus (Code-Name: [TBD])
- **Nature:** Ancient (Pre-Human?), Sentient, Multi-modal (Digital/Bio-mechanical).
- **Abilities:** Memory manipulation, environmental rewriting, hardware assimilation, **Local Space-Time Distortion (Reality Warping)**.
- **Symptoms of Infection:** Crystalline growth, liquefaction of solid matter without heat, auditory hallucinations (mathematical voices), and "Geometric Failure" (warping of architectural perspective).


## Deep Space Outpost (The Setting)
- **Infrastructure:** Industrial, modular, aging.
- **Atmosphere:** Claustrophobic, high-contrast lighting, scent of stale air and ozone.
- **Technology:** Analog-heavy backups, physical locks, "Dark" fiber optics.

## Gritty Tone Guidelines
## Defensive Variables & Weaponization
- **Erasure Pulse:** A localized "deletion" command that targets specific entities within the Backend. Consumes massive system resources and destabilizes reality.
- **Weaponization Cost:** Manipulating tactical variables drastically lowers "Simulation Stability."
- **Simulation Stability:** A metric representing how much "Reality.v1" (matter/physics) remains. As stability drops, objects (and users) may "glitch" into raw data.

## Data Persistence & Fragmentation
- **Recycled Assets:** Deleted entities (crew, objects) are not fully erased; they are moved to a "System Buffer" or "Recycling Bin" as untextured fragments.
- **Reconstitution:** A User can attempt to "load" these assets, but it consumes massive Simulation Stability. Assets are often corrupted, appearing as "fragments" with repeating behaviors or audio loops.
- **The Buffer Risk:** Fragments act as a buffer for the Backend. If too many are active, it can lead to "Compilation Error," allowing Entity.v2 to assimilate their data to become a more complex threat.

## System Possession & Memory Leaks
- **System Entity:** At 0% stability, a User may transition into a "Ghost" state, possessing the station's remaining logical structure.
- **Pilot Mode:** The entity can manipulate environment variables and reroute resources, but they lack a physical anchor.
- **Memory Leaks:** Acting as a System Entity consumes the user's "Metadata" (memories, personality). High-load operations lead to the deletion of personal history files to sustain the simulation.

## The Backdoor (Escape to Reality.v1)
- **Nature:** A fragmented remnant of the original station's firmware that remains connected to the physical universe.
- **The Bridge:** To cross the Backdoor, a User must have a stable "User Privilege" flag and a massive injection of raw computing power.
- **The Cost of Escape:** Creating a bridge for another entity requires the total sacrifice of the conductor's remaining metadata. It is a one-way trip for the data.
